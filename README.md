# PongyPong
Pongy Pong application as a Unity project
This application was built for iOS but but has since been removed from the Apple App Store

Files I've made can be found in the Assets folder, code I wrote is found in the Assests/Scripts folder (.cs files)
all code I wrote for the project was done in C#

The game involves tapping each side of the screen to stop two pong balls from hitting the
ground. Ads can be viewed to continue after failure.
